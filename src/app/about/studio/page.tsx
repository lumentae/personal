      <p className="mb-4 text-lg">
        Lumentae Studios is an independent game development studio focused on creating immersive, polished, and meaningful experiences. We specialize in atmospheric storytelling, intuitive gameplay mechanics, and thoughtful world design.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4 text-lg">
        Our mission is to build games that leave a lasting impression - games that aren’t afraid to slow down, make you think, or tell stories in subtle ways. We believe that every detail, from sound design to UI, contributes to the feeling of a living, breathing world.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4 text-lg">
        In addition to game development, we’re building our own open-source game engine - a flexible and transparent foundation for creative expression. While our games are closed-source, the tools we create aim to empower other developers to bring their visions to life.
